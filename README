per - Simple unix permission viewer and converter

Per is a simple utility that can verbosely print unix permissions and
convert between symbolic and numeric notations and vice-versa.

Synopsis:
per [OPTIONS] TARGET

OPTIONS:
  -S      Treat notations as special notations.
  -v      Print permissions verbosely.
  -n      Print permissions in a numeric notation.
  -s      Print permissions in a symbolic notation.
Options may be chained (e.g. -vns). Providing no options defaults to -vns.
Providing only -S as an option defaults to -Svns.

TARGET may be:
  * A symbolic notation (e.g. rwxr-xr-x)
  * A numeric notation (e.g. 755)
  * A file (e.g. /etc/passwd)
  * A literal dash '-'

If TARGET is a literal dash '-', it will be replaced with a first line from stdin.

If -S option is used, per will accept and print special notations (e.g.
rwsrwsrwT or 6775).

Examples:
  Printing a file permission verbosely
per -v /etc/passwd

  Converting a special numeric (octal) notation into symbolic
per -Ss 6775

  Copying a file permission
chmod `per -Sn file1` file2
