per - Simple unix permission viewer and converter

per is a simple utility that can verbosely print unix permissions and
convert between symbolic and numeric notations and vice-versa.

Synopsis:
per [OPTIONS] TARGET

OPTIONS:
  -v      Print permissions verbosely.
  -n      Print permissions in a numeric notation.
  -s      Print permissions in a symbolic notation.
Options may be chained (e.g. -vns). Providing no options defaults to -vns.

TARGET may be:
  * A symbolic notation (e.g. rwxr-xr-x)
  * A numeric notation (e.g. 755)
  * A file (e.g. /etc/passwd)

Special notations (sticky bits etc.) are currently not supported but they will
be in the future.

Building:
Build deps: GNU make
Runtime deps: (only on GNU/Linux) libbsd
Run `make' (`gmake' on non-GNU systems) and wait a sec. The build will
produce a binary called `per' which you can copy to somewhere into
your $PATH (e.g cp per /usr/sbin/). Building was tested on OpenBSD and
Artix GNU/Linux but should also work on different system (including
different *BSDs). You can also compile it by hand, in GNU/Linux
systems you have to pass `-lbsd' into your compiler in order to do
this.
